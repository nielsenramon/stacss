The unobtrusive SCSS framework.

STACSS is a lightweight structured SCSS directory which scaffolds basic styles, variables and indispensable modules.

## Installation

Copy the contents of `/scss` into your application `scss` folder and you are ready to go!

## Optional

Note that STACSS requires [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for optimal use. Installing it inside your project is recommended.

Feel free to add the `.stylelintrc` config file as well. It makes sure your SCSS is linted and it enforces consistent conventions in your stylesheets. More info about Stylelint [here](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint).

None of the above is required but highly recommended.
